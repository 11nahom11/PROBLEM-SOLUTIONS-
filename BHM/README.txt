Project:Bounded History Manager (Java)
Name:Thomas Kiflu

Bounded History Management is a technique used to store a limited number of recent actions or events.
Instead of keeping all history forever, the system keeps only the most recent N items.

Bounded History Management is useful when:
Memory is limited
Only recent actions matter
Old data becomes irrelevant
Performance must stay fast
